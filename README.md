Heya!

This is my space for building things. 

What kind of things you ask?  Anything useful, really!

My main stack, for now:

<img src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/javascript" width="24" /> <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/react/react-original.svg" width="24" /><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/python/python-original.svg" width="24" />
 
 But I am keeping an eye out for a little birdie... <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/swift/swift-original.svg" width="24" />

Here's a view of what's there to see:

**TallyX**
 - The first! Saw some counter extensions on chrome that didn't look good so I decided to make my own and dial it up to a 11.
 - It's not rocket science but it taught me a lot about the development process.

 **BuddyIn (INP)**
 - Applying to jobs is hard + I'm good at coding + Most tools out there are either a cash grab or AI spam bots = A *quality-over-quantity* based application tool
